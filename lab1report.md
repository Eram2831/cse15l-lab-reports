In this lab I learned how to go through the files using only the terminal. We did the same thing in the lecture as well and it was very helpful since I was able to practice it even more in lab. Additionally learning how to create a website on github was very interesting. While creating the website I did have trouble since I was on an iPad however the TA was able to help me and I was able to successfully create the website.





a) cd


  1) ![Image](1st screenshot.png)
     

I was in the home directory.

This command takes me to the home directory since there is no arguments.

No there was no error.

The reason there was no output or change was because I was already in the home directory so it didn't change anything.
     
     
  3) ![Image](1b screenshot.png)
     

     The working directory was home.

     This command takes me to the specified directory in the argument that is stated at the end of the command.

     There was no error since when I put the command it successfully directed me into the lecture1 directory.
     
  5) ![Image](1a screenshot.png)
     

     I was in the lecture1 directory.

      This command displayed an error stating that Hello.class is not a directory.

     There was an error.

     There was an error since the directory that was stated at the end was a file and a not an actual directory. 


b) ls


  1) ![Image](2aa screenshot.png)
     

     I was in the home directory.

     Since there was no argument, it defaulted to the home directory.

      In this command it lists all of the contents in the home directory.

      There was no error since it listed all of the contents that are in the home directory.
     
  3) ![Image](2b screenshot.png)
     

     The working directory is the home directory.

      This command shows all of the contents in the lecture1 directory.

      There was no error since it listed all of the contents in the lecture1 directory.
     
  5) ![Image](2c screenshot.png)
     

     I was in the home directory.

      There was no output and instead it displayed an error stating that there is no Hello.class file or directory.

      Since I did not put a directory or a java file, there was an error stating that there is no directory or file called Hello.class.


c) cat


  1) ![Image](3a screenshot.png)
     

     I was in the home directory.

      There was no output since it is waiting for the user to input something.

      There was no error. 
     
  3) ![Image](3b screenshot.png)
     

     I was in the home directory.

      After putting lecture1 as the argument, it stated that lecture1 is a directory and showed an error.

      There was an error since the cat command is not able to perform the concatenation on a directory.
     
  5) ![Image](3c screenshot.png)
     

     I was in the home directory.

     Putting lab1.txt as the argument made whatever was in the lab1.txt file to be displayed.

      There was no error since instead of putting a directory, I instead put a file.
